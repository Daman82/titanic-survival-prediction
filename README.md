## Project Overview
A machine learning classification project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using demographic and ticket information. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

**Kaggle Competition Rank:** [Add after submission] | **Accuracy:** [Add after completion]

## Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, passenger class, and family relationships.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Training Set:** 891 passengers
- **Test Set:** 418 passengers
- **Features:** 11 (PassengerId, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked)
- **Target Variable:** Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Key Insights from EDA
[Add after you complete analysis - examples:]
- 74% of females survived vs. 19% of males
- Higher passenger class had better survival rates
- Children under 10 had higher survival probability
- [Add 2-3 more insights with visualizations]

## Technologies & Libraries
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning models
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Development environment

## Feature Engineering
[Add after you complete - examples:]
1. Created `FamilySize` = SibSp + Parch + 1
2. Extracted `Title` from passenger names (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, etc.)
3. Filled missing age values using median by Title and Pclass
4. Created `IsAlone` binary feature
5. Binned `Fare` into categories

## Models Tested
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] |
| Random Forest | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] |
| Gradient Boosting | [%] | [%] | [%] | [%] |

**Best Model:** [Model Name] with [X]% accuracy

## Results
- **Training Accuracy:** [X]%
- **Cross-Validation Score:** [X]%
- **Kaggle Public Leaderboard Score:** [X]%

## PART 3: CREATING YOUR PERSONALIZED LEARNING SCHEDULE

Let me create a schedule based on **how many hours you can commit per week**. 

### Tell me your situation:

**How many hours can you realistically dedicate per week?**
- 5-10 hours (very part-time)
- 10-15 hours (moderate, what I recommended)
- 15-20 hours (serious commitment)
- 20+ hours (full-time learning)

**What days/times work best for you?**
- Weekdays only
- Weekends only
- Mix of both

**Do you work full-time, part-time, or are you currently not working?**

**What's your energy level like?**
- Morning person (best focus early)
- Night owl (best focus evening)
- Midday learner

---

**While you think about those questions, here's a FLEXIBLE 15-hour/week schedule as a starting point:**

### SAMPLE SCHEDULE (15 hours/week)

**WEEKDAYS (Monday-Friday): 2 hours/day = 10 hours**

**Morning Routine (if morning person):**
- 6:00-7:00 AM: Coursera video lectures (1 hour)
- 7:00-8:00 AM: Hands-on coding/Kaggle exercises (1 hour)

**OR Evening Routine (if night owl):**
- 7:00-8:00 PM: Coursera video lectures (1 hour)
- 8:00-9:00 PM: Hands-on coding/Kaggle exercises (1 hour)

**WEEKENDS (Saturday-Sunday): 2.5 hours/day = 5 hours**

**Saturday:**
- 10:00 AM-12:30 PM: Project work (2.5 hours)
  - EDA, feature engineering, or model building

**Sunday:**
- 10:00 AM-11:00 AM: Project work continuation (1 hour)
